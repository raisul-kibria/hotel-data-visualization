# Hotel Data Visualization
This project is a basic demonstration of exploratory data analysis and classification. Few maxplotlib and pandas functions are used for data visualization. The dataset used here is a 'Hotel booking demand dataset' found in the web. It seems the original source is [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.11.126) by N. Antonio et al.<br>  Apart from this, three classifiers- SVC, MLP and Random forest classifier from scikit-learn library are also used for a presented classification scenario.<br>  This project is an introduction on how to begin. Do research more and use other libraries as well.
